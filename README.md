# Typed Jest
The type definition for [`jest`](https://github.com/facebook/jest).

# Differences with DT version
* Definition was updated to match the latest version of jest (0.9.2+)
* Definition doesn't copy any jasmine stuff, so it will not conflict with existing jasmine definition
* You need to install jasmine type definition separately (it will warn you on install)
* You can add any definitions for jasmine custom matchers easily
